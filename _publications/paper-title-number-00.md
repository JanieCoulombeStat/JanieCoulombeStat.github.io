title: "Estimation of the Marginal Effect of Antidepressants on Body Mass Index under Confounding and Endogenous Covariate-Driven Monitoring Times"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2021-06-28-paper-00-Endogenous
excerpt: 'We tackle estimation of the marginal effect of a binary exposure in settings where the covariate process interacts with monitoring times all throughout follow-up time (we call "endogenous" such process). We also depict via several causal diagrams the biasing paths caused by covariate-driven monitoring times.'
