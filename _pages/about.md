Research Interests
======

My doctoral research is focused on the development (or transfer to the causal framework) of statistical methods that account for covariate-dependent monitoring times. I am privileged to be supervised by <a href="https://www.ericamoodie.com/">Professor Erica EM Moodie</a> and co-supervised by <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/epi-biostat-occh/robert-william-platt">Professor Robert Platt</a>. 


<a href="https://janiecoulombestat.github.io/publication/2020-04-25-paper-1-Weighted-Regression">In previous work</a>, we considered (biasing) imbalances in the data due to both confounding factors and outcome-dependent monitoring times when making causal inference on the marginal effect of an intervention on a continuous, longitudinal outcome. 

We also extended that work to the setting where the covariate process affecting visit times is endogenous; endogeneity may create long-term dependencies between the outcome and the monitoring processes (work recently submitted for review).

Other broad interests are in semiparametric theory (multiply robust estimators), optimal adaptive treatment strategies, and stochastic processes/multistate model theory for causal inference.


Background
======

Prior to my doctoral studies, I worked for two years as an analyst statistician in the McGill Pharmacoepidemiology Unit at the Lady Davis Research Institute, Jewish General Hospital, Montreal, CA, under the supervision of <a href="http://www.ladydavis.ca/fr/samysuissa">Dr. Samy Suissa</a>. At the time, this work gave me access to observational data (from e.g. electronic health records data and administrative databases) from which I learned a great deal. 

Rather than more theoretical statistical questions, I have become more and more interested in research questions that are of interest to the scientific community of epidemiologists and pharmacoepidemiologists. Therefore, I plan on directing future research in applied areas where there is a lack of well adapted causal inference methods. I am interested in collaborations with health scientists who have interesting and complex questions to answer, and who are willing to collaborate with a statistician.

Besides my doctoral research, in 2019-2020, I have had the chance to be involved on a <a href="https://janiecoulombestat.github.io/publication/2020-10-08-paper-2-ADDrugs">project</a> led by Professor Erica Moodie, in which we developed an optimal adaptive treatment strategy for patients suffering with depression. That rule was developed with the aim to choose between citalopram and fluoxetine (two commonly prescribed antidepressant drugs) based on patients' characteristics. See the <a href="https://academic.oup.com/aje/advance-article/doi/10.1093/aje/kwaa261/6028713?searchresult=1">commentary</a> by Drs Shiner and Watts and our <a href="https://janiecoulombestat.github.io/publication/2020-12-04-paper-3-Response-AD">response</a>, as well as a link to the  <a href="https://reporter.mcgill.ca/individual-patients-arent-average-patients-personalized-approaches-to-depression/">McGill Reporter</a> short interview).
