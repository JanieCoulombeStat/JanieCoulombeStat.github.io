Research Interests
======

My doctoral research is focused on developing or transferring statistical methods that account for informative monitoring times to the causal framework. In previous work, I have considered imbalances due to both confounding factors and outcome-dependent monitoring times while accounting for mediating factors; these features, when not considered properly, may bias the inference on the marginal effect of an intervention. 

In a first project (P1), we proposed and compared two estimators for the marginal effect of an intervention on a longitudinal outcome with data subject to informative monitoring times and confounding; the estimators extended the theory on generalized estimating equations (Liand and Zeger, 1986) and the equations of Lin and Ying (2001). In a second doctoral project, I tackled endogenous covariate processes that may affect and may interact with monitoring times in continuous, during patients' follow-up. In a third project, I extended the estimators proposed in (P1) to a setting where the outcome is categorical, using a proportional odds model (McCullagh, 1980), and when the exposure is continuous rather than binary by extending the IPT weight to one that is generalized (Robins, 2000). The estimator is applied to learn about the marginal effect of the time spent on video games on the number of suicide attempts in American adolescents.

My main supervisor is Professor <a href="https://www.ericamoodie.com/">Erica EM Moodie </a> and I am co-supervised by Professor Robert Platt, in the Department of Epidemiology, biostatistics and Occupational Health, at McGill University. Other broad interests are in semiparametric theory (multiply robust estimators), optimal adaptive treatment strategies, and stochastic processes/multistate model theory for causal inference.


Background
======

Prior to my doctoral studies, I worked for two years as an analyst statistician in the McGill Pharmacoepidemiology Unit at the Lady Davis Research Institute, Jewish General Hospital, Montreal, CA, under the supervision of Dr. Samy Suissa. At the time, this work gave me direct access to plenty of real data (from e.g. electronic health records data and administrative databases), and I learned a great deal about their specifities and their pitfalls. Rather than more theoretical statistical questions, I have become more and more interested in research questions that are of actual interest to the scientific community in epidemiology and pharmacoepidemiology; I therefore aim to direct future research in applied areas where there is a lack of causal inference methods. I am interested in collaborations with health scientists who have interesting and complex questions to answer and wish to collaborate with a statistician (or a team of statisticians).

Besides my doctoral research, in 2019-20, I have had the chance to be involved on a project led by Professor Erica EM Moodie where we developed an optimal adaptive treatment strategy for patients suffering with depression. That rule was developed with the aim to choose between citalopram and fluoxetine (two commonly prescribed antidepressant drugs) based on patients' characteristics. The manuscript was well received, and accepted for publication in the American Journal of Epidemiology, and a commentary followed (to which we responded). This project particularly sparked in me the desire to do more applied work in which I answer important health-related questions.
