News
======

I am happy to announce that I started a postdoctoral fellowship at McGill University in September 2021, working in collaboration with Professor Erica E. M. Moodie in the Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Occupational Health.  

In the Fall 2021, I was supposed to visit North Carolina State University (NCSU) for 6 months as a research scholar and to work in the Department of Statistics with Professor Marie Davidian. Due to the covid19 pandemic, McGill University currently bans non-essential travels, and Professor Davidian and I will be collaborating virtually. I am very excited about this opportunity.  

 
Research Interests
======

My doctoral research was focused on causal inference, and the development (or transfer to the causal framework) of statistical methods that account for covariate-dependent monitoring times. I recently defended my doctoral thesis in biostatistics at McGill University - I had the privilege to be supervised by <a href="https://www.ericamoodie.com/">Professor Erica EM Moodie</a> and co-supervised by <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/epi-biostat-occh/robert-william-platt">Professor Robert Platt</a> during my doctoral studies. 

<a href="https://janiecoulombestat.github.io/publication/2020-04-25-paper-1-Weighted-Regression">In previous work</a>, we considered (biasing) imbalances in the data due to both confounding factors and outcome-dependent monitoring times when making causal inference on the marginal effect of an intervention on a continuous, longitudinal outcome. 

We also <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.14364.pdf">extended that work</a> to the setting where the covariate process affecting visit times is endogenous; endogeneity may create long-term dependencies between the outcome and the monitoring processes (work invited for revision).

In a more recent manuscript, we extended that work to the scenario where the exposure is continuous, and the outcome is ordinal (work recently accepted for publication in Statistics in Medicine). In that setting, a generalized inverse probability of treatment weight was used to account for confounding, and the proportional odds model was used to model the association between the exposure and the outcome. The methodology was applied to assess the marginal effect of an increase in the time spent playing video games on suicide attempts, in the Add Health study in the US.

Other broad interests are in semiparametric theory (multiply robust estimators), optimal adaptive treatment strategies, and stochastic processes/multistate model theory for causal inference. 

Background
======

I hold a Bachelor in Mathematics (Université de Montréal) and Masters in Statistics (Université de Montréal).

Prior to my doctoral studies, I worked for two years as an analyst statistician in the McGill Pharmacoepidemiology Unit at the Lady Davis Research Institute, Jewish General Hospital, Montreal, CA, under the supervision of <a href="http://www.ladydavis.ca/fr/samysuissa">Dr. Samy Suissa</a>. There, I worked extensively with observational data (from e.g. electronic health records data and administrative databases) and I learned a great deal through conducting complex data analyses and collaborating with world-renowned experts in pharmacoepidemiology. Following this, I have become more and more interested in research questions that are of interest to the scientific community of epidemiologists and pharmacoepidemiologists. 

I am interested in collaborations with health scientists who have interesting and complex questions to answer and would like to collaborate with a statistician on these research projects.

Besides my doctoral research, in 2019-2020, I have had the chance to be involved on a <a href="https://janiecoulombestat.github.io/publication/2020-10-08-paper-2-ADDrugs">project</a> in which we developed an optimal adaptive treatment strategy for patients suffering with depression. That rule was developed with the aim to choose between citalopram and fluoxetine (two commonly prescribed antidepressant drugs) based on patients' characteristics. See the <a href="https://academic.oup.com/aje/advance-article/doi/10.1093/aje/kwaa261/6028713?searchresult=1">commentary</a> by Drs Shiner and Watts and our <a href="https://janiecoulombestat.github.io/publication/2020-12-04-paper-3-Response-AD">response</a>, as well as a link to the  <a href="https://reporter.mcgill.ca/individual-patients-arent-average-patients-personalized-approaches-to-depression/">McGill Reporter</a> short interview.
